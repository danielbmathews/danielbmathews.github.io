# Find
_Sometimes analytics projects get handed to you. Well-defined with a clear path to impact. This is the rare situation._

## Discovering projects

The team's overall time commitment should be split up according to the 70/20/10 rule.
- 70% are strategic projects that are aligned to OKRs. 
- 20% are projects that arise between OKRs. These projects are often asks from partner or client teams. They don't warrent waiting for the next OKR quarter / semester.
- 10% are projects directed from within the team. These are infrastructure improvements, removing tech debt, training, etc.

Remember even though you follow all the best practices, many projects will fail.

## Prioritizing

Use a variant of the [BCG matrix](https://www.bcg.com/about/our-history/growth-share-matrix.aspx). On the vertical axis, map out the business impact. On the horozontal axis map out feasibility / speed of delivery. This leads you to prioritize projects from the upper right quadrant. For a more sophisticated prioritization schema see [this](https://hbr.org/2018/10/how-to-decide-which-data-science-projects-to-pursue)
