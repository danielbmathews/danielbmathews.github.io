*Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.* -Dwight Eisenhower

Create a framework to:

1. Finding projects e.g. from LT, from partners, generating from team.
1. Minimum criteria for projects e.g. data (or a plan to get it), business objectives, business owner, deadline.
1. Prioritizing projects e.g. business priorities; people / ladder fit.
1. Partnering with other PA/DS teams e.g. mentorship, peer review
1. Documenting projects e.g. what docs are required, where and how to capture them
1. Analyst role e.g. data discovery, clean-up, question requirements

## Principles

- Impact: Resources are limited, so projects are prioritized.
- Aligned: Our results are aligned with our org. This shouldn't rule out 20% projects.
- Quality: Results produced are trustworthy.
- Reusable: Results produced can be reused beyond a single project.
- Durable: Results produced live beyond a single analyst.
- Flexible: We have a process to change the direction of the project. 
- Career development: Speaking the same language as the boarder community.

Each project will be unique. The goal here is to create a lightweight and flexible framework that standardizations expectations and can serve as a checklist.
