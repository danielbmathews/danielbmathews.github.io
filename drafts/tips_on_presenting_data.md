# Tips on presenting data effectively

Judging the success of a data product can be a complex. Much depends on the product, context, users, etc. To get it simple, I limit that measure of success to be three categories. 

* Right solution
* Awareness
* Accuracy


1. Ensure that you can direct a user to the report/dashboard from a verbal conversation lasting less than 20 seconds. #navigation
1. Use a gradual reveal. This helps the users get context. #navigation
1. Allow a link off to primary data e.g. individual records or entities. This builds trust in users. #dataquality
1. Build for the color blind
1. Build using a predictable process. User requirements. User testing. User support.
1. Do a hallway test. Walk up to a data savvy person who is not familiar with the project and ask them to interpret the dashboard. If preparing a dashboard or presentation, seek out someone to review the work. Ideally choose someone who is most closely related to the target audience i.e. right level of product familiarity and possibly right level of seniority.
1. Segment your users. See see spoons, forks, sporks.
1. Have supporting documentation. I have never been a fan of presentations. I respect Edward Tufte’s “information density”. But they have become ingrained as a way to share information. Specifically the average business user doesn’t shutdown when they see a presentation like they do when they are confronted with a whitepaper or a jupyter notebook. This self-supporting documentation is useful for remote users.
1. Choose the right tool. Don't over or under build.
1. Measure usage. Directly if possible by seeing usage, especially repeated usage by the target audience over time. The ideal sign are folks quoting your work as the cause for them taking action.
1. When choosing to build a feature or not: "What would you differently?"
1. Know the data trail. Garbage in, Garbage out. How is it collected? How frequently is it sent back? Who is monitoring the quality? 
1. Know any potential privacy concerns.
