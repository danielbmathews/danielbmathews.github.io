The viewpoints in the following post are my own and not meant to represent an official stance from Google.

Traditionally the challenges of data work have focused on the technology aspect. 

1. Volume
1. Variety
1. Velocity

I agree these aren't trivial. But this miss what I believe are bigger problems.

1. Missing. We don't have the data. Perhaps it was never collected; perhaps privacy concerns prevent it being collected; perhaps its too expensive to collect.
1. Messy. The data is of poor quality. Perhaps it was improperly sampled; perhaps it was never tested; perhaps the owners/process/tools/etc changed over time and this introduced problems.
1. not Mine. The data is out there, but its owned by someone else. Could be internal or external - but either way they don't want to share.
