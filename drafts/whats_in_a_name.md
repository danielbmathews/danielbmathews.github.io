STATUS: DRAFT

- Statistics is a new science and has grown rapidly
- the naming has had a strong bias toward adopting quirky names

Example from physics
- Quark properties - strangeness. Rumored to affect funding for particle accelerators.

## Regression

- But only valid if M <1 e.g. heights of fathers and heights of sons.
- A better name would be linear modeling

## T test
- From notes on a black board

## A better way
- Visualization has [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447)
